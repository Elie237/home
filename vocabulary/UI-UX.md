<strong>Card Sorting</strong><br>
Card sorting, is a user research method that asks users to arrange information into groups that make sense to them. The card sorting technique allows you to develop an effective, user-friendly sitemap and information architecture. You use pieces of paper, cards, or an online card sorting tool to get started with this research technique.<br><br>

<strong>Data-Driven Design</strong><br>
Design that is backed by data and helps understand the target audience better is known as data-driven design. Data helps prove, reveal, and improve your design. It proves that your work is on the right track, it reveals the usersâ€™ pain points and opportunities while unearthing new trends, and it improves your designs by adding objectivity to them.
