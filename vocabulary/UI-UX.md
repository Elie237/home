# . Widget
___
A widget is an on-screen element that users interact with.

 For example: social media icons, sliders, buttons, and contact forms, to name a few.


 To create a widget,You need to understand the core features of your App, pick the most valuables specialties and transform them into Widgets. A Widget can work with iPhone, iPad, and Mac, so you need to choose the right context and the platform to develop your Widgets.

 if you want to designing a widget,a widget must be glanceable, relevant and personalized. This means that it has to be concise and have a main purpose for the user. It needs to summarize a core feature of the App and the design has to be clear. Widgets can support different sizes, make sure to choose the ones that make more sense for your app and your users.

In conclusion,making a widget for your App will enhance the user experience; remember to keep it personal, to create a connection between the user and your App. Also, it needs to be relevant and informational. The widget needs to show just the things that matter to the user. The right information at the right time.

# . Double Diamond 
___
The Double Diamond is a visual model to understand  the process of design. Its near-universal appeal arises from its simple focus on both the problem and solution.

Steps to follow :

### Working in the Problem & Solution
___

The big idea in the Double Diamond is that design work in the problem is just as important as the solution.

Designers are commonly known as problem solvers. Designers won’t argue that point because we do solve problems. We do more than that, however, and the Double Diamond shows that there are two distinct activities in design: problem-finding and problem-solving.

It’s a huge paradigm shift for designers to become problem-finders. Designers have been working as problem-finders through the 20th century, and the Double Diamond is a simple visual that represents design in the 21st century.

The great thing about the Double Diamond is that even if you've never heard of it, you're probably already using it. This process model has endured the test of time because it’s simple, and it communicates how the design process feels.

### Divergent & Convergent Thinking
___

Design requires a different kind of thinking than other activities. The Double Diamond describes the mental approach of design using the duality of divergent and convergent thinking. 

Divergent thinking is free-flowing, non-linear, and feels “creative” to some. It helps you explore multiple angles and perspectives while you work. 

Convergent thinking is focused and linear and can feel like narrowing down to the “right” answer. It helps you scope down projects to the conquerable and deliverable, and it’s essential to balance divergent thinking.

These two ways of thinking form the diamond shapes. The diamond shapes in the Double Diamond are the real genius behind this model. That shape comes from the divergence-convergence models proposed by Béla H. Bánáthy and Nigel Cross.

As this new way of thinking about design began to take hold in Europe, The UK Design Council took these “kite-shaped” divergence-convergence models and applied them to the design environment of the early 2000s. Today, the mindsets of divergence and convergence help designers communicate how they think and work in the design process. 

## The Problem Space
The first diamond is known as the Problem Space. Often labeled the “Research” diamond, the first diamond is where you explore, synthesize, and define problems. The Problem Space introduced the idea that designers can be researchers or problem-finders.

Before designers develop a solution, they must understand the problem they are trying to solve. How do you think designers come up with such innovative solutions? Creative ideas are not the result of an innate gift; they result from a systematic understanding of the world. 

The Double Diamond communicates that work in the Problem Space is a natural part of creating. Since design began in the early 1900s, designers have been working in the Problem Space, but the Double Diamond really brought this way of working into the spotlight for non-designers.

The Problem Diamond is so complicated that there are even whole design careers dedicated to it, like UX Research and Strategic Design.

## The Four D’s of the Double Diamond

Activities in the problem and solution are so different that the Double Diamond is broken into four distinct phases. As you move from left to right, each phase has a theme to guide your work.

### Discover
In the Discover Phase, your goal is to immerse yourself in the problem completely through research. In this phase, you should seek to understand, rather than assume, the context of the problem. Discover is the phase where you will conduct exploratory research into the problem or challenge presented. Anything from a field visit to past research can help you explore your problem.



#### Key Activities :

Planning with stakeholders and finding the context

Conducting primary research with customers and relevant experts

Utilizing existing research through secondary or desk research



### Define
In the Define Phase, your goal is to turn your research data into a conquerable problem. In this phase, use your research to define the challenge into a final problem statement. This final problem statement will have more context than the original problem, which will be helpful for the solution work in the next diamond. The process to connect research data with design ideas is called Design Synthesis, and it’s a key part of this phase. This phase is all about putting some organization to the mess of empirical data and forming a concise problem statement.

#### Key Activities:

Identifying customer wants vs. needs

Analyzing and synthesizing research data and forming insights

Scoping the problems down to a final problem statement

### Develop
In the Develop phase, your goal is to generate potential solutions for the problem you've defined. Just as you went broad with your research, go comprehensive with possibilities of solutions. Develop is the phase where you will generate ideas informed by the first diamond. Seek inspiration from multiple sources and share the creativity with as many stakeholders as you can.

#### Key Activities:

Sketching, wireframing, and prototyping solutions in low fidelity

Collaborating and co-creating with stakeholders

Forming hypotheses and designing experiments

#### Deliver
In the Deliver Phase, your goal is to validate the solutions that work and prepare the design for release into the real world. At the beginning of this phase, you will start to weed out the solutions that don't work with early prototyping and testing. As you begin to hone in on what is working, you will iterate and prepare the design for its launch in the real world. This final implementation phase ends with the design work completed.

#### Key Activities:

Testing prototypes or solutions with customers to get early validation

Iterating and preparing assets for launch

Launching pilots, features, and experiments to learn about the customer

# Final Summary :
The diamonds in the Double Diamond come from divergent & convergent thinking

The problem and solution diamond work in tandem to create better outcomes

The Four D’s of the Double Diamond are Discover, Define, Develop, and Deliver

A design process model isn’t a recipe; it’s a communication tool
