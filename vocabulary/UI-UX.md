  # UI Elements
User Interface (UI) elements are virtual items on a website’s interface that allow users to engage with the design. E.G buttons, slider arrows, navigation bars, dropdown lists, message boxes. 


# User-Centered Design (UCD)
It emphasizes the end user throughout the design and development process. The goal is to produce a design that aligns with the wants and needs of the user. To this end, UCD revolves around continuously researching, testing, and checking features within the product to deliver a design that appeals to users.

# Design Thinking 
It is a design methodology that provides a solution-based approach to solving problems. It is use in tackling complex problems that are ill-defined or unknown, by understanding the human needs involved, by re-framing the problem in human-centric ways, by creating many ideas in brainstorming sessions, and by adopting a hands-on approach in prototyping and testing.

# Brainstorming

It is a method design, teams use to generate ideas to solve clearly defined design problems. i.e is a group format problem-solving/ creativity technique, in which a group of people uses their collective intelligence to approach a creative problem.
