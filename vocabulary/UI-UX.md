# **Experience Architecture**
Experience architecture is a map that lays the outline of the path that a user will take from the start to the intended goal. It is a combination of several UX and design processes:

**Information architecture**: chalking out and designing an information model
**Interaction design**: developing a structure and pattern of actions or behaviors for a design and its users
**Experience design**: working out how a design will function across multiple platforms

# **Breadcrumbs**
If breadcrumbs bring the Grimm Brothers’ famous fairytale of Hansel and Gretel to mind, then you are on the right page. Because the term breadcrumbs in design lingo is also borrowed from the fairy tale.

**Breadcrumbs** are secondary navigation aids that tell users where they are on a website. These allow users to retrace their steps on multilevel websites. Despite their secondary status, breadcrumbs have been in use since 1995, helping make designs user-friendly.

`UX/UX DESIGN TERMINOLOGIES`   

`Mockup`

    Typically mid to high fidelity, mockups reflect the design choices for;
    * color schemes
    * layouts
    * typography
    * iconography
    * the visuals of navigation

`Benefit of Mockup`

* `Intuitive to stakeholders`

  Thanks to their higher fidelity, mockups require less context than lo-fi documents like wireframes. Stakeholders can more easily see the final product.

* `Realistic perspective`

  It’s one thing to have all your visual decisions made, but it’s another to see them all working together in a way close to the real thing. Mockups can help reveal problems that aren’t so apparent on paper (for example, color clashes, or smaller type crimes going unnoticed).

* `Early revisions`
  
  It’s easier to make revisions in a mockup than in the later coding stages (as long as the mockup itself isn’t coded).

`A/B Testing`

  is also referred to as split testing. It is the process that asks users to pick from two versions of your design. The products are presented side by side to a group of users to learn which they like better.

  The aim is to test different versions of a product simultaneously to learn about the differences in user preference and behavior between the two. A/B tests are conducted when a working model of the design has been framed.

# Definition of New words under UI/UX course.

1. **Wire-Frame**- It is a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website. 

2. **Prototype**- A prototype is a rudimentary working model of a product or information system, usually built for demonstration purposes or as part of the development process. 

3. **Visual Designer**- Someone who designs for a variety of platforms, which may include Internet and intranet sites etc.

4. **Design Cycle** - Tt is a series of tools used by designers to help them create and evaluate solutions in response to design problems.


   

## Vocabularies for UI-UX Design
<hr>
<strong>Card Sorting</strong><br>
Card sorting, is a user research method that asks users to arrange information into groups that make sense to them. The card sorting technique allows you to develop an effective, user-friendly sitemap and information architecture. You use pieces of paper, cards, or an online card sorting tool to get started with this research technique.<br><br>
## UI/UX DESIGN VOCABULARY
***
* ****USABILITY TESTING**: this is a technique used to evaluate how intuitive and useful a particular design is
* ***EYE TRACTING**:is a technology that measures eye movements and makes it possible to know where a person is looking, what they are looking at, and for how long their gaze is in a particular spot
* **IDEATION**: is a creative process where designers generete ideas in sessions
* **FIGMA**b: is a powerful design tool that helps you to create anything: websites, applications, logos, and much more
1. _**Divergent thinking**_ -  is free-flowing, non-linear, and feels “creative” to some.
2. _**UX Experience**_ - This is how the user feel about a program.
3. **Personas**_ - These are fictional characters whose goals and characteristics represent the needs of a larger group of users.
4. _**End Users**_ - These are the final users who use the product.
5. _**UX Booth**_ - is a publication by and for the user experience community.
  # UI Elements
User Interface (UI) elements are virtual items on a website’s interface that allow users to engage with the design. E.G buttons, slider arrows, navigation bars, dropdown lists, message boxes. 


# User-Centered Design (UCD)
It emphasizes the end user throughout the design and development process. The goal is to produce a design that aligns with the wants and needs of the user. To this end, UCD revolves around continuously researching, testing, and checking features within the product to deliver a design that appeals to users.

# Design Thinking 
It is a design methodology that provides a solution-based approach to solving problems. It is use in tackling complex problems that are ill-defined or unknown, by understanding the human needs involved, by re-framing the problem in human-centric ways, by creating many ideas in brainstorming sessions, and by adopting a hands-on approach in prototyping and testing.

# Brainstorming

It is a method design, teams use to generate ideas to solve clearly defined design problems. i.e is a group format problem-solving/ creativity technique, in which a group of people uses their collective intelligence to approach a creative problem.

## UI/UX Vocabularies

### Flat design
* Flat design is a UI design style that focuses on employing simple, two-dimensional elements with bright colors.
### Interactive design
* Interaction design is a type of web design that is centered around creating an engaging interface with logical actions and behaviors. Successful interaction design is based on the use of technology and a clear understanding of good communication to create the desired user experience.

## Pain points:
are the problems users face that create friction in certain user flow
## user flow:
is simply, the term “user flow,” also known as “UX flow,” refers to a visual representation of a specific route that a user might take through your website or app in order to achieve a goal.
## user research:
 is the process that used to investigate a certain problem in more methodologist manner.
 ## Quantitative:
  research is any research that can be measured numerically.
  ## Qualitative:
  research is sometimes called “soft” research.

<strong>Data-Driven Design</strong><br>
Design that is backed by data and helps understand the target audience better is known as data-driven design. Data helps prove, reveal, and improve your design. It proves that your work is on the right track, it reveals the users’ pain points and opportunities while unearthing new trends, and it improves your designs by adding objectivity to them.
