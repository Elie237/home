`UX/UX DESIGN TERMINOLOGIES`   

`Mockup`

    Typically mid to high fidelity, mockups reflect the design choices for;
    * color schemes
    * layouts
    * typography
    * iconography
    * the visuals of navigation

`Benefit of Mockup`

* `Intuitive to stakeholders`

  Thanks to their higher fidelity, mockups require less context than lo-fi documents like wireframes. Stakeholders can more easily see the final product.

* `Realistic perspective`

  It’s one thing to have all your visual decisions made, but it’s another to see them all working together in a way close to the real thing. Mockups can help reveal problems that aren’t so apparent on paper (for example, color clashes, or smaller type crimes going unnoticed).

* `Early revisions`
  
  It’s easier to make revisions in a mockup than in the later coding stages (as long as the mockup itself isn’t coded).

`A/B Testing`

  is also referred to as split testing. It is the process that asks users to pick from two versions of your design. The products are presented side by side to a group of users to learn which they like better.

  The aim is to test different versions of a product simultaneously to learn about the differences in user preference and behavior between the two. A/B tests are conducted when a working model of the design has been framed.
