# **Experience Architecture**
Experience architecture is a map that lays the outline of the path that a user will take from the start to the intended goal. It is a combination of several UX and design processes:

**Information architecture**: chalking out and designing an information model
**Interaction design**: developing a structure and pattern of actions or behaviors for a design and its users
**Experience design**: working out how a design will function across multiple platforms

# **Breadcrumbs**
If breadcrumbs bring the Grimm Brothersâ€™ famous fairytale of Hansel and Gretel to mind, then you are on the right page. Because the term breadcrumbs in design lingo is also borrowed from the fairy tale.

**Breadcrumbs** are secondary navigation aids that tell users where they are on a website. These allow users to retrace their steps on multilevel websites. Despite their secondary status, breadcrumbs have been in use since 1995, helping make designs user-friendly.
